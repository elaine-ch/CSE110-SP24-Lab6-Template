# Explore: More testing with CRUD Apps

In this part of the lab, we will want you to create some E2E tests for the notetaking CRUD app provided (to launch the website, open **index.html** with Live Server). It is a simple note taker app with some basic functionality, and it will be left up to you as to how testing should be conducted. The rest of the source code for the notetaking app can be found in the **src** folder. We will require you to create multiple tests to make sure all the different aspects of the app are working properly together, so make sure your tests cover all the features of the app in order to receive full credit. We suggest looking through the code and to play around with the app itself to help you decide what to test.

And once you are ready to write tests go ahead and write them in the **part2.test.js** file. You may also add whatever other supporting files you need to run E2E test in general. Once you have finished writing your tests and they pass, please screenshot the output in the terminal showing the results of running your tests.


Notetaking app features (this may help you figure out what tests you need to write to cover everything):
- Add new note
- Edit new note (edited note is saved by clicking outside of the note, or pressing tab- a focused note cannot be deleted or saved)
- Edit existing note (edited note is saved by clicking outside of the note, or pressing tab- a focused note cannot be deleted or saved)
- Notes are saved locally (notes are still there after refreshing page)
- Delete note by double clicking on note
